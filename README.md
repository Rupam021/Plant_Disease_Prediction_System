# Plant_Disease_Prediction_System
The Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture is designed to utilize artificial intelligence and image processing in the early identification of plant diseases, thus enabling timely interventions and reducing agricultural losses.

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system that can classify plant diseases accurately using a diverse image dataset.
